**EMSlicense.ps1** - Powershell module to assign\disable EMS plans in a Office365 EMS Sku

This one use the azureAD pshell module instead of the msonline:

**EMSLicenseAzureAD.ps1** - using AzureAD Pshell - Seems to be working stable.
	to do: add template user usage (copy licenses plan from a user, using command line)

**azureADLicensesNotes.txt** - some notes for me


**EMSLicense.usage.txt** - usage notes

Code backported to Pshell 3 (no longer require Pshell5 due to some constructs)
